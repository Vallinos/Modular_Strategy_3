		<h1>Accessibility Web Design</h1>

		<p>
			For this project I am attempting to make a web application page that is more accessible to people of varied
			needs.
			As a result, this page would be used to showcase a number of methods that would allow for more
			accessibility. This page will focus on HTML, Python, Flask, and CSS.<br>
			<a href='https://github.com/Vallinos/Modular_Strategy_3' target=_blank>Github Repository</a><br>
			The following is what I researched to make for a more accessible web page:


		<h2> Visual Impairment </h2>

		For example, I put a slider that would help users with potential visual impairments by providing options for
		text size.<br>

		(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=144#resize-text"
			target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.4.4</a>)
		<br>
		This gives users the ability to choose between a few font sizes, ranging from 20px to larger sizes for users to
		more easily read the text.
		<br><br>
		I have put it here to demonstrate along with a sample sentence: </p> <br>


		<center>
			<select id="vis1">
				<option value="20px">Default</option>
				<option value="28px">28px</option>
				<option value="36px">36px</option>
				<option value="48px">48px</option>
				<option value="72px">72px</option>
			</select>
		</center>
		<br>
	
		<div id="vis">
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
			magna aliqua.
	
		</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>

				The colors should also remain consistant throughout the web page so as to not disorientate users while
				they use the application,
				text will remain one certain color, links will be a certain color, and the headers should remain
				consitant.
				For this web application the text will be blue, the links will be red, and the headers will be green.
				Why would I choose these strange colors you might ask.
				It is to move on to the next point. <br>

				(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=144#use-of-color"
					target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.4.1</a>)

				<br><br>

				There are a number of people in the world who have some sort of color vision deficiency. About 8% of men
				and .4-.5% of women report some deficiency in green/red vision.
				There are also individuals in rare cases, about .05% of people, who have deficiency in seeing blue.
				Additionally, there are common groupings of colorblindness that are commonly
				seen, those being protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. <br></p>

				<center>
					<image src="{{url_for('static',filename='cb.png')}}" , width="500" height="500"> <br>
						(<a href="https://www.colorlitelens.com/color-blindness-correction-info.html"
							target=_blank>colorlitelens</a>) <br>
						(<a href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40"
							target=_blank>davidmathlogic</a>) <br>
				</center>
				<br>
				<p>
				With this being the case, I have chosen to include additional buttons to switch to a color vision
				contrast to specifically contrast for protanopia colorblindness
				that would convert all text, headers, and links to a contasted colorscheme. Text would be a different
				shade of blue,
				header 2 would be orange to contrast the default green while header 1 would be a shade of violet,
				red will also be another shade of red. The background changes from tan to a more pinkish tan as well.
				These would create better contrast for protanopia.
				The option to switch would be at the top.

			Images could be used along with text to provide further context to the text. <br><br>
			<center>
				<image src="{{url_for('static',filename='writing.jpg')}}" , width="500" height="500"> <br>
			</center>
			Images such as this one may help users to associate meaning to text that they may not intitally understand
			depending on level of learning needs. <br>

				target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.1</a>)
			<br><br>

			<h2> Auditory Impairment Accessibility  </h2> <br><br>
			<p>
			I can also create further accessibility by including in my web application audio samples that could help to
			read the text to the user should they need the assistance. <br></p>

			(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=111%2C144#media-alternative-prerecorded"
				target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.3</a>)

			<br><br>
			I have provided an audio sample here: <br></p>

			<center>
				<audio controls>
					<source src="{{url_for('static',filename='audiosample1.wav')}}" , type="audio/wav">
				</audio>
			</center>

			<br>
			<p>
			Beyond recording spoken sound clips that could be used to read samples of text, text to speech can be
			employed for use by the user to read text selections.
			You can highlight any of the text in this web application and text to speech will read it for you. Go on,
			try it.<br></p>


			(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility"
				target=_blank>Mozilla</a>) <br>

			<br>
			<p>

				Videos can also be employed to help provide visual representation of information, as well as screenshots
				or slides, like I used on the landing page.
				If a video is shown all spoken audio shown be reflected in a transcript. This is to be accessible to
				people with a potential hearing disability. <br>

				(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=111%2C144#media-alternative-prerecorded"
					target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.3</a>)

				<br>

				<center>
					<video width="700" height="550" controls>
						<source src="{{url_for('static',filename='transcriptvid.mp4')}}" , type="video/mp4">
					</video>
				</center>

				<br>

			<div id="transcript">
				Transcript for spoken part of video:
				<br>"Were I to have a video embeded to provide for visuals to replace text, I would also want to provide
				a transcript for what was said in the video."
			</div>

			<br>
			<p>
			Should there be audio of any kind, whether in a video or in a soundbite, text should be included to be more
			accessible. <br>

			(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=111%2C144#audio-description-prerecorded"
				target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.2.5</a>)

			<br>

			Any audio that is included should be toggled to be played, it is strongly recommended so as to not
			interefere with people with sensitive hearing in using the web application, and
			all audio should include a slider to adjust volume levels as the audio for my soundbite and video has.</p>

				target=_blank>WCAG 2: 1.4.2</a>) <br>
			<p>
			Furthermore, use of signlanguage in videos or including captions could create a more accessible means of
			people with hearing impairment to use the web application. <br><br></p>

			<h2> Accessible  Framework</h2> <br><br>
			<p>

				I have made sure that each link is clearly visible by giving them a distinct color making it easier to spot for
			the user. <br>
			In addition to buttons being clearly labeled at the top of the web application, there should be buttons placed
			at the bottom of the application that are clearly visible to the user.
			An important option to be provided for the user is to be able to ascend back to the top of the web application.
			Pressing the button labeled "Back to Top" would take the user back to the top to be used at the user's
			discretion. There is also a scrolling back to top bottom
			that moves along with the user as they scroll down the screen to go back to the top at any point if necessary.
			<br>

			(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=111%2C144#navigable"
			target=_blank>WCAG 2: 2.4</a>) <br>

			The other buttons, to simplify the web application's navigation to the user would take them to the other two
			implementations as well as the landing page. <br>
